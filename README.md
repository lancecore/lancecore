# Lance Boer ⚡️ Front End Developer and Project Lead

## I’ve been building on the web since the ’90s, and professionally for over 15 years.
## In that time, I’ve worked with a wide variety of clients across multiple industries, led many projects and people, and even taught web development.

I build with PHP, React, Next.js, WordPress, HTML, CSS, Sass, Tailwind CSS, and much more.

Projects beginning with 'wddep' were created for use by my students in my [Web Design and Development Employment Program](https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2020SDPR0052-002110).
